Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Application written in Java for their game application to be run on Android OS.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think the recommendation since I researched on device and OS limitations before writing recommendations.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Seeing the ULM diagram really does help when it comes to implementing the code because it tells you the classes, their variables and methods, and the relationships they have among each other.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Probably the system-arquitecture view because even though it wasn't required, I would have liked to have given it a try.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It's important to consider the user's experience because they will be the ones using the application and ultimately supporting the business that funding the development of the application.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
More UML diagrams, I felt it really helped much better than writing simple notes.
